## files and folders

The entire application is divided in components, and there is only one page.

 - all the **components** are in the **src\app\components** folder
 - all the **services** are in the **src\app\services** folder
 - all the **pages** are in the **src\app\pages** folder


## URL caching 

All the url requests have been properly cached using the shareReplay poperator using RxJs

> An innovative way of handling the cache is also used
